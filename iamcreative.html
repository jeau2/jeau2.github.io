        This is my favorite song.<br>
        The confusing time signature, the relaxing lack of lyrics, the swift speed, and the industrial sounds of machines clanging<br>
        perfectly organize with a slightly soothing feeling of lonliness/uncertainty<br>
        to drive me to sleep, keep me alert, or put me to work.

        This is another good song.<br>
        The time signature is normal this time, relieving you of whatever confusion you may still have from the previous one.<br>
        This song is also quite relaxing, having absolutely no vocals aswell, and having a slower pace than the last song.<br>
        The feeling of lonliness is here aswell, but doesn't feel as uncertain as the last one, and feels more reassuring.<br>
        The only instrument is synths, making the song sound really artificial in a good way.<br>
        This song also helps me with productivity and sleep.
